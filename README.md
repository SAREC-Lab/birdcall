# Birdcall

Birdcall is a mobile phone application that enables the user to control their drone using their voice. The user will speak commands into the app, which will communicate with an onboard Raspberry Pi to send commands to the drone. The user will be able to set up waypoints through an on screen UI, since it would be cumbersome to speak coordinates.
